## The Planning Process

Before I started coding, I explored different design and layout ideas. It was difficult to narrow it down, but once I did, I began to wireframe on Figma. I wireframed two different color options: light and dark.

I ended up going with the dark colored option.

## Future Considerations

In a futre iteration, I will add an option to view the site in light and dark mode.
